# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is QUI?

QUI is a full UI addon for World of Warcraft Midnight that combines a combat HUD, frame positioning tools, action bar styling, minimap and panel customization, group tools, quality-of-life helpers, and profile management in one package.

## Why do I see many QUI folders?

QUI 4 is modular. The `QUI` folder is the core addon, and `QUI_*` folders provide feature modules such as options, chat, bags, datatexts, and the damage meter. Addon-manager installs handle this automatically. If you install manually, copy every `QUI*` folder from the release zip.

## Which modules are off by default?

The biggest opt-in modules are **QUI Chat**, **Group Frames**, **Bags**, **Info Bar**, and **Alts**. Enable them from `/qui` > **Module Addons** when you want those systems. Some need a reload before taking full effect.

## How do I move frames?

Use **Layout Mode** for QUI-controlled HUD elements like CDM, unit frames, group frames, minimap-related panels, and similar custom pieces. Use Blizzard's own **Edit Mode** for Blizzard-controlled elements. If something still needs fine tuning, check the positioning settings inside `/qui`.

## What is CDM?

CDM stands for **Cooldown Manager**. It is QUI's signature cooldown display system, built to keep your important abilities, buffs, and procs close to your character so your eyes stay near the action.

## What is Layout Mode?

Layout Mode (`/qui layout`) is QUI's visual editor. It lets you drag major HUD elements, open layout-specific settings, and keep related pieces aligned without guessing at offsets.

## How do I set up keybinds?

Type `/kb` to enter keybind mode (powered by LibKeyBound). In this mode:

1. Hover your mouse over any action bar button.
2. Press the key you want to bind to that button.
3. The keybind is applied immediately.
4. To unbind, hover over the button and press the currently bound key again.
5. Type `/kb` again to exit keybind mode.

## Why are my action bars hidden?

Most likely, mouseover fade is active. Move your mouse over the area where the bars should be. If you want them always visible, open `/qui`, go to **Action Bars**, and turn the fade behavior off.

## How do I enable group frames?

QUI Group Frames are opt-in. Open `/qui`, select **Group Frames**, enable them, and reload if prompted. Use **Edit in Layout Mode** afterward if you want to reposition them.

They have separate party and raid setups, so you can keep them lightweight in small groups and more information-dense in raids.

## How do I enable QUI Chat?

Open `/qui` > **Module Addons** and enable **QUI Chat**, then reload if prompted. QUI Chat is optional; if you leave it off, your normal chat remains in place with the non-takeover styling features that are enabled.

## How do I open Bags or Alts?

Enable the module first from **Module Addons**. Bags uses `/quibags`; Alts uses `/alts` or `/quialts`. If either command says the module is disabled, turn it on and reload if prompted.

## Why does Alts not show every character's inventory yet?

The account cache fills as you log into characters. After a cache reset or first install, offline inventory and equipment data repopulate the next time each character logs in.

## Why can I not click things in combat?

Combat locks down some protected UI actions. If a move, toggle, or secure interaction does not apply immediately during combat, QUI will wait and apply it after combat ends.

## How do I change fonts and textures?

Open `/qui`, go to **Appearance**, and start with **Fonts** or **UI Scale**. Those pages change a large part of the addon's overall look very quickly.

## Can I import just part of a profile?

Yes. During import, you can choose only the parts you want, such as visual styling or layout positions, without replacing the rest of your setup.
