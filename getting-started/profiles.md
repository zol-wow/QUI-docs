# Profiles

QUI uses the **AceDB** profile system to manage your settings. Profiles let you save, switch, copy, and share complete configurations.

## How Profiles Work

- **Default profile:** When you first log in, QUI creates a `Default` profile that all characters share.
- **Per-character profiles:** You can create a profile for a specific character. That character will use its own settings while others continue using the Default profile.
- **Copying and resetting:** You can copy settings from one profile to another, or reset a profile back to defaults.

Manage your profiles in `/qui` under the **Profiles** tab.

## Spec-Based Profile Switching

QUI integrates with **LibDualSpec** to automatically switch profiles when you change specializations. This is useful if you want different UI layouts for healing versus DPS, for example.

To set this up:

1. Open `/qui` and go to the **Profiles** tab.
2. Enable dual-spec profile switching.
3. Assign a profile to each of your specializations.
4. When you change specs, QUI will automatically load the associated profile.

## Import and Export

QUI supports importing and exporting profiles as compressed text strings, using **LibDeflate** for compression. This makes it easy to share your setup with others or back up your configuration.

1. Open `/qui` and go to the **Import & Export Strings** tab.
2. To **export**, select the data you want to export and copy the generated string.
3. To **import**, paste a profile string into the import field and click Import.

Profile strings include validation checks (maximum depth of 20, maximum of 50,000 nodes, and type checking) to ensure safe imports.

## Partial Imports

Since v2.53.0, QUI supports importing only specific parts of a profile string. When importing, you can select individual categories to apply:

- **Theme / Fonts / Colors** -- Update visual settings without moving frame positions.
- **Layout / Positions** -- Update frame positions without changing visual settings.
- **Module-specific** -- Import settings for specific modules (loot, skinning, etc.) independently.

This is useful when you want to adopt someone else's color scheme without losing your carefully positioned frame layout, or vice versa.

## Bundled Presets

QUI ships with several built-in profile presets that you can import from the **Import & Export Strings** tab:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Quazii Profile** | The standard QUI layout and settings. |
| **Quazii Dark Mode** | A darker visual variant of the standard profile. |
| **Quazii Details!** | Details damage meter profile complementing QUI's style. |
| **Quazii Plater** | Nameplate settings for the Plater addon. |
| **Quazii Platynator** | Nameplate settings for the Platynator addon. |
| **QUI Edit Mode Base** | The base Blizzard Edit Mode layout string (for Blizzard Edit Mode import). |
| **Quazii Edit Mode** | Quazii's original Blizzard Edit Mode layout string. |

## Reset All Movers

If you have repositioned QUI frames and want to return them all to their default positions, use the **Reset All Movers** button found in the Profiles or Anchoring tab. This resets frame positions without affecting your other profile settings.

## SavedVariables

QUI stores its data in two SavedVariables files:

- **QUI_DB** -- Primary database (AceDB profiles, per-character settings, global settings).
- **QUIDB** -- Secondary storage.

These files are located in your WoW installation at:
```
World of Warcraft\_retail_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT>\SavedVariables\QUI.lua
```

They are saved automatically when you log out or reload the UI.

## Migration Test Matrix

Use this checklist when validating changes to profile import, layout migration, or SavedVariables upgrades.

### Required Fixtures

- One `main`-era healing profile with non-default frame positions.
- One `main`-era `QUI1:` export string from the same character/profile.
- One old SavedVariables file copied before installing the next-version addon.

### Scenario 1: Old SavedVariables Upgrade

1. Install the next-version addon over the old SavedVariables file.
2. Log in on the healing character and let the addon load normally.
3. Verify that these elements still match the `main` branch look before touching any settings:
   - player, target, focus, pet, boss, and ToT frames
   - party and raid frame placement
   - cast bars and power bars
   - CDM essential and utility containers
   - loot window, loot history, and loot roll spacing
   - minimap, micro menu, and bag bar visibility
   - objective tracker, alert toasts, and ready-check/consumable anchors
   - addon accent/theme output

### Scenario 2: Old Profile Import

1. Start from a clean or throwaway next-version profile.
2. Import the `main`-era `QUI1:` string as a full profile replacement.
3. Repeat the same visual checks from Scenario 1.
4. Import the same string again into a named target profile and confirm the result is identical.

### Scenario 3: Selective Import Guardrails

1. From a customized next-version profile, selectively import only `Theme / Fonts / Colors`.
2. Confirm colors/fonts update without moving anchors.
3. Selectively import only `Layout / Positions`.
4. Confirm anchors move without replacing unrelated theme choices.
5. Selectively import loot/skinning-related categories and confirm old `general.skinLoot*` payloads land in `loot`, `lootRoll`, and `lootResults`.

### Pass Criteria

- No frame snaps back to next-version defaults unless the old profile also used those defaults.
- Old loot, roll-frame, and minimap visibility choices survive both upgrade paths.
- Old mint-accent profiles do not silently become sky blue.
- Re-importing or relogging is idempotent: the second load looks the same as the first.
