# Profiles

Profiles are how QUI remembers your setup. If you understand this page, you can experiment much more freely without worrying about losing your preferred layout.

## The Simple Version

- Use **one shared profile** if you want multiple characters to look the same.
- Use a **character-specific profile** if one character needs a different layout or role setup.
- Use **spec-based switching** if you want a healing layout in one spec and a damage layout in another.

Manage your profiles in `/qui` under **General > Profiles**.

{: .note }
Module Addons are not the same thing as profiles. Enabling or disabling a `QUI_*` feature addon is account-wide, while most styling, layout, and behavior choices remain profile-based.

New profiles are seeded from QUI's curated defaults automatically, so a fresh profile starts from a sensible setup rather than an empty one. Existing profiles are never touched. (Profiles older than schema v31, from before 3.5.11, are backed up and reseeded from the starter preset at login.)

## When To Use Each Option

- **Shared profile**: best for players who want one consistent UI everywhere.
- **Character profile**: best when one class needs unique spacing, trackers, or bars.
- **Spec profile**: best when your roles are very different, like healing versus damage.

## Spec-Based Switching

QUI can automatically switch profiles when you change specializations. This is one of the best quality-of-life features in the addon if you play multiple roles.

To set this up:

1. Open `/qui` and go to **General > Profiles**.
2. Enable dual-spec profile switching.
3. Assign a profile to each of your specializations.
4. When you change specs, QUI will automatically load the associated profile.

## Import and Export

Profiles can be imported and exported as shareable strings. This is the easiest way to:

- try a new setup without rebuilding everything manually
- share your UI with a friend
- keep a backup before a big redesign

1. Open `/qui` and go to **General > Import / Export**.
2. To **export**, select the data you want to export and copy the generated string.
3. To **import**, paste a profile string into the import field and click Import.

## Partial Imports

You do not always need to replace your whole setup. QUI can import only specific parts of a profile.

- **Theme / Fonts / Colors** -- Update visual settings without moving frame positions.
- **Layout / Positions** -- Update frame positions without changing visual settings.
- **Module-specific** -- Update only the area you care about.

Partial imports cover profile data. They do not install missing module folders or override the account-wide Module Addons enable state.

This is especially useful when you like someone else's style but want to keep your own frame placement.

## Bundled Presets

QUI includes bundled imports so you have a stable place to start:

- **QUI Edit Mode Base** for the base layout import.
- Bundled profile presets for players who want a ready-made starting point.

## Reset All Movers

If you have repositioned QUI frames and want to return them all to their default positions, use the **Reset All Movers** button found in the Profiles or Anchoring tab. This resets frame positions without affecting your other profile settings.

## Backup Tip

If you have a setup you really love, export it before making major changes. That gives you an easy rollback point even if you later decide to rebuild from scratch.
