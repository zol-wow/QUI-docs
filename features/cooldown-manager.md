# Cooldown Manager

The Cooldown Manager (CDM) is QUI's core feature. It displays your ability cooldowns as icon rows near your character, giving you at-a-glance visibility of what is ready, what is cooling down, and what is about to come off cooldown -- all without looking at your action bars.

## Overview

The CDM organizes your abilities into **containers**, each with its own layout, icon size, and behavior. It knows your class and spec, automatically populating the containers with relevant spells. You can further customize what appears through per-character custom entries and the **Composer** interface in Layout Mode.

## How to Access Settings

CDM settings are accessed through **Layout Mode** or the `/cdm` shortcut:

- Type `/qui layout` to enter Layout Mode, then use the toolbar and drawer to access CDM settings.
- Type `/cdm` in chat to open CDM settings directly.

## Engines

QUI ships with two CDM engines:

- **Owned** (default) -- Addon-created frames managed entirely by QUI. This is the active, maintained engine and the one you should use. It supports the full container system, Composer, per-spell settings, aura containers, and all modern features.
- **Classic** -- A legacy engine that hooks into Blizzard frames. It exists for backward compatibility but is no longer actively developed.

The engine is set in your profile and defaults to "owned."

## Container System

The owned engine uses a flexible **container** system. Each container has a type that determines what it tracks and how it displays:

- **Cooldown** -- Tracks ability cooldowns. The Essential and Utility bars are cooldown containers.
- **Aura** -- Tracks buffs and debuffs as icon displays (replaces the old "Buff Icons" concept).
- **Aura Bar** -- Tracks buffs as status bars with progress indicators (replaces the old "Tracked Bar" concept).

```

Containers can be positioned independently in Layout Mode and each has its own layout settings (icon count, icon size, growth direction, rows, etc.).

## Key Features

- **Essential Container** -- Your primary rotation abilities. Defaults to 8 icons per row with up to 3 rows. Default icon size is 39px.
- **Utility Container** -- Defensive and utility cooldowns. Defaults to 6 icons per row (row 1 only; rows 2-3 are disabled by default). Default icon size is 30px.
- **Aura Containers** -- Tracked buff and aura display with customizable shape, growth direction, and duration/stack text.
- **Aura Bar Containers** -- Status bars for tracked buffs with inactive mode options: always visible, fade out, or hide entirely. Supports custom fill colors for individual bar entries.
- **Composer** -- A Layout Mode interface for managing what spells appear in each container, reordering them, enabling/disabling individual spells, and configuring per-spell settings.
- **Custom Entries** -- Per-character spell or item additions to the Essential or Utility containers. Stored in your character-specific database (`db.char`), so each character can have unique additions.
- **Spec-specific custom entries** -- Custom CDM entries can be configured per-specialization, allowing different tracked spells for each spec.
- **Per-Spell Settings** -- Individual spells in the Composer can have per-entry overrides for enabled/disabled state, glow behavior, and other display options.
- **Effects** -- Glow types (Pixel Glow, Autocast Shine, Button Glow) and swipe overlays for GCD, cooldown, and buff duration visualization. Separate swipe color defaults for aura and cooldown swipes.
- **Range Indicator** -- Tints icons red when your target is out of range for that ability.
- **Usability Indicator** -- Shows when abilities cannot currently be used (insufficient resources, wrong stance, etc.).
- **Desaturation** -- Icons go desaturated while on cooldown for clear visual distinction.
- **Keybind Display** -- Shows your keybind text on each icon so you always know which key to press.
- **Click-to-Cast** -- CDM icons can function as clickable buttons with macro resolution and secure overlays.
- **Rotation Helper Overlay** -- Integrates with WoW's `C_AssistedCombat` API to highlight suggested abilities.
- **Growth Direction** -- Configurable growth direction for containers (horizontal/vertical, left/right, up/down, center).
- **Target Debuff Tracking** -- Aura containers can track debuffs on your target using `auraDataUnit` and `linkedSpellIDs` for ability-to-debuff mapping.

## Visibility Rules

The CDM supports several visibility modes that control when containers appear:

- Always visible
- In combat only
- When you have a target
- While in a group
- On mouseover
- Custom combinations of the above
- Hide when mounted, flying, skyriding, or in a vehicle

Configure these in the CDM visibility settings or via the HUD Visibility tab.

## Tips

{: .note }
Custom entries are stored per-character, not per-profile. If you add a trinket to your Essential container on one character, it will not appear on another character even if they share the same profile.

{: .note }
You can add both spells and items as custom entries. This is especially useful for tracking trinket cooldowns or on-use items alongside your rotation abilities.

{: .note }
The Composer in Layout Mode is the primary tool for managing your CDM spell list. Use it to reorder spells, enable/disable individual entries, and adjust per-spell settings without leaving Layout Mode.
