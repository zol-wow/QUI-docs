# Group Frames

QUI Group Frames are an opt-in replacement for Blizzard's party and raid frames. They are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled. Once active, they provide auto-scaling layouts, extensive healer-focused features, click-casting, and fine-grained control over indicators and auras.

## Overview

Group frames automatically adapt their size based on your current group composition. In a 5-player party they are larger and more detailed; in a 40-player raid they shrink to keep everything visible. The frames support role-based sorting, group-based organization, click-casting bindings, dispel overlays, and custom aura indicators per specialization.

## How to Enable

Group frames are **disabled by default**. To enable them:

1. Enter Layout Mode with `/qui layout`.
2. Access Group Frames settings through the Layout Mode toolbar or drawer.
3. Toggle the **Enable Group Frames** option.
4. Reload your UI when prompted.

Group frame settings are managed through Layout Mode, not the main `/qui` options panel. Click-casting settings are in the dedicated **Click-Cast** tab in `/qui`.

## Key Features

- **Auto-scaling dimensions** -- Frame sizes adjust by context: party (200x40), small raid (180x36), medium raid (160x30), large raid (140x24).
- **Layout controls** -- Grow direction (up/down), group grow direction (left/right), spacing between frames, and sorting by role, index, or name.
- **Group organization** -- Group by GROUP, ROLE, or CLASS.
- **Health display** -- Styles include percent, absolute, both, or deficit (showing missing health).
- **Power bar** -- Optional, with power-type-specific coloring.
- **Name text** -- Class color option and maximum length truncation.
- **Indicators** -- Role icon, ready check, resurrection status, summon pending, leader/assistant, target marker (raid icons), threat border, and phase icon.
- **Healer features** -- Dispel overlay highlighting dispellable debuffs, target highlight showing your current target in the group, my-buff indicator for tracking your own HoTs/shields, and defensive indicator for tracking external cooldowns.
- **Separate party and raid profiles** -- Party and raid frame settings are stored independently, allowing different sizing, sorting, and indicator options for each context.
- **Row growth direction** -- Configurable growth direction options for horizontal and vertical layouts, including CENTER growth direction for icon layouts.
- **Click-casting** -- Customizable mouse-button bindings per specialization. Includes smart resurrection, unit menu actions, ping actions, and scroll wheel click-casting. Click-casting also extends to unit frames and target-of-target. Settings are in the dedicated Click-Cast tab.
- **Auras** -- Debuff icons (default 3 max), buff icons, duration-based coloring, and expiring pulse animation when a buff is about to fall off.
- **Power Infusion tracking** -- Option to track Power Infusion on group frames.
- **Custom aura indicators** -- Per-specialization presets for tracking specific buffs and debuffs with custom positioning on the frame.
- **Always show me first** -- Option to pin your own frame at the top of the group frame list regardless of sorting rules, ensuring you always know where your frame is in raid.
- **Spotlight** -- Pin specific group members by role or name to a separate group, useful for keeping tanks or key players always visible in a consistent location.
- **Range check** -- Out-of-range players fade to a configurable alpha, giving you instant visual feedback on who you can reach.
- **Class power pips** -- Optional display of combo points, holy power, chi, etc.
- **Castbar** -- Optional per-unit castbar. Disabled by default for performance in large groups.
- **Portrait** -- Optional unit portrait on each frame.
- **Pet frames** -- Optional frames for group members' pets.
- **Indicator sizing** -- Configurable sizing options for indicators on group frames.
- **Blacklist filter** -- Filter out specific auras from the group frame display.
- **Group Frame Composer** -- A visual tool for configuring group frame layout and settings within Layout Mode.
- **Test mode** -- Preview group frames with configurable party or raid counts without needing an actual group. Available through Layout Mode.

## Tips

{: .important }
Group frames require a UI reload when first enabled or disabled. This is because they replace Blizzard's secure group frame headers, which can only be swapped at load time.

{: .note }
Click-casting bindings are stored per-specialization. If you play multiple specs (e.g., Holy and Retribution on a Paladin), each spec can have completely different click-cast setups.

{: .note }
Test mode is invaluable for configuring raid frames. You can preview how your frames look with 5, 10, 20, or 40 players without needing to join an actual group. Access it from the Group Frames settings.

{: .important }
Enabling castbars on group frames in a 40-player raid can impact performance. If you notice frame rate drops in large groups, consider disabling group frame castbars.
