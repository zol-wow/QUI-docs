# Changelog

This page summarizes the user-facing changes since the last mainline release. For every beta entry and technical fix, see the full [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/zol-wow/QUI/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Current Release: 5.2.3-beta7

{: .warning }
**WoW 12.1 only.** This build targets patch 12.1 (interface 120100) and will not load on the 12.0.x client.

QUI 5.2.3-beta7 makes the Alts window resizable and adapts its Weeklies and
Currencies tables to their localized content.

{: .important }
Back up your `WTF` folder before updating. Manual installs must copy every `QUI*` folder from the release zip into `Interface\AddOns\`.

## What's New in 5.2.3-beta7

### Alts

- **The Alts window can be resized from its bottom-right corner**, with its
  position, anchor, width, and height preserved across reloads.
- **Weeklies now has localized column headers**, and both Weeklies and
  Currencies size their left-aligned columns from the rendered text.
- **An active Alts move or resize stops cleanly when combat begins**, preventing
  the window from continuing to follow the cursor through combat.

## What's New in 5.2.3-beta6

### Profiles

- **Aura Displays and Group / Raid Frames can be pinned across all profiles**
  from one canonical source, including active-specialization layout settings.
- **Individual destination profiles can Ignore a global pin for local edits**
  and use Apply to restore the shared settings.

### Combat UI

- **Objective Tracker styling stays off Blizzard's native update and resize
  paths**, preserves native Scenario dimensions, and restores the Scenario
  tracker after QUI's Mythic+ timer closes.
- **Cooldown Manager waits for Blizzard to load its native viewer**, avoiding
  tainted settings callbacks during later loadout changes.
- **Manual castbar widths work when Auto-Width is off or the anchor is
  disabled**, and the settings preview shows the configured width.
- **Keybind scans skip OPie macro-editor widgets**, preventing its editor-only
  `GetAction` API from being called as an action button.
- **Expanding Group Frame aura settings keeps every following control in
  place**, including Targeted Spells, Dispel settings, and guidance text.
- **Inactive Aura Display movers remain usable in Layout Mode** at their saved
  size instead of collapsing when the display has no active icons.
- **Cooldown Manager pressed effects apply only to cooldown icon containers**,
  leaving buff icons unaffected.
- **Group Frame aura layering waits until combat ends** instead of reading
  protected frame state during combat.
- **Resource bars refresh automatically when Fluid Form changes forms**, so Cat
  Form combo points appear without a manual refresh.
- **Action Bar range and usability colors clear when their live condition
  ends**, including after mount and display changes.
- **New Action Bar tints respect autohide state**, staying hidden through full
  and partial fades until the bar is fully revealed.
- **Cooldown Manager Edit Mode corrections save once and immediately require a
  reload**, avoiding protected Cooldown Viewer errors during continued play.
- **Micro Menu ownership stays with Blizzard during temporary UI transitions**,
  including Override Action Bars and Pet Battles.
- **The Info Bar Shop button uses Blizzard's guarded toggle path**, closing open
  panels before the Shop appears and respecting restricted UI states.

## What's New in 5.2.2

### Profiles and displays

- **Feature settings can be shared across profiles**, including Aura Displays
  and Group / Raid Frames, without replacing click-cast bindings.
- **Tracked aura displays can keep inactive icons visible** with configurable
  placeholder behavior and styling.

### Combat feedback

- **Action Bar range and usability colors follow native state events** through
  paging, stance, combat, and slot changes without disrupting shared events.
- **Cooldown Manager cooldown icons support configurable pressed effects** and preserve
  cast highlights across reanchored, pooled, and remapped icons.
- **Cooldown and consumable state follows Blizzard's live sources**, including
  charge metadata, aura phases, item counts, and partial source updates.

### Group content and utility

- **Group-frame debuff gradients expose non-dispellable types** while actionable
  dispels keep their full overlay and cleanse-ready glow.
- **Group-frame click-casting supports items**, and raid releases can require
  Ctrl after a three-second safety delay.
- **The Lust Timer follows Blizzard's native aura state** during combat, while
  castbars, bank controls, and startup paths avoid protected mutations.

## What's New in 5.2.1

### Combat fixes

- **Incoming casts** can be tracked in a dedicated display alongside the rest
  of the QUI combat HUD.
- **Cooldown Manager aura and cooldown state** stays safe and complete through
  secret-value, target, roster, and combat refreshes.
- **Group-frame dispel indicators** follow live unit state, dispellable types,
  frame alpha, and Enrage coverage.

The broader 5.2 feature set remains available below.

### Profiles and setup

- **Named account-wide nameplate profiles** can be created, assigned by specialization, imported, and exported.
- **Aura displays have guided load-condition pickers** for classes, specializations, roles, and encounters, plus a faster create/list/preview workflow.
- **Quick feature toggles in the options sidebar** keep module switches close to the settings they control.

### Combat UI

- **Action bars stay responsive in combat**, including cooldowns, glows, pressed states, assisted-rotation indicators, paging, stance changes, and special bars.
- **Cooldown Manager tracking is more reliable** for spell variants, tracked buff bars, tooltips, keybind labels, frame levels, row opacity, and in-combat refreshes.
- **Group frames gain custom health colors and tracked-aura bar controls**, including orientation, styling, and expiring-state colors.

### Trackers and utility

- **The objective tracker has refreshed styling**, with improved icons and progress bars while preserving safe in-combat updates.
- **The Mythic+ timer keeps boss, objective, and weighted progress data current** through combat.
- **New 12.1 consumables and targeted mail, bag, tooltip, skinning, and help fixes** round out the release.

## Upgrade Notes

- Install 5.2 over the existing QUI folders; saved variables remain in `QUIDB` and `QUI_StorageDB`.
- Manual installs must copy every top-level `QUI*` folder from the release zip, not only the `QUI` folder.
- If a feature does not open, check `/qui` > **Module Addons** before troubleshooting its settings.
- Some account-cache data, especially offline inventory and equipment, repopulates as each character logs in.
